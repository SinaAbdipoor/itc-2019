/**
 * <p>This abstract class represents distribution constraints as defined in the ITC 2019. Besides the already described
 * time and room constraints and student course demands, there are the following distribution constraints that can be
 * placed between any two or more classes. Any of these constraints can be either hard or soft. Hard constraints cannot
 * be violated and are marked as required. Soft constraints may not be satisfied and there is a penalty for each
 * violation.</p>
 * <p>Each constraint may affect the time of the day, the days of the week, the weeks of the semester, or the room
 * assigned. Constraints from the upper two sections of the table are evaluated between individual pairs of classes.
 * For example, if three classes need to be placed at the same starting time, such a constraint is violated if any two
 * of the three classes start at different times. Distribution constraints from the last section of the table need to
 * consider all classes for evaluation between which the constraint is created.</p>
 * <p>When any of the constraints that can be validated on pairs of classes is soft, the provided penalty is incurred
 * for every pair of classes of the constraint that are in a violation. In other words, if M pairs of classes do not
 * satisfy the distribution constraint, the total penalty for violation of this constraint is M × penalty. It means that
 * the maximal penalty for violation of one distribution constraint is penalty × N × (N − 1)/2, where N is the number of
 * classes in the constraint.</p>
