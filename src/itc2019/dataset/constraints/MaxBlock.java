/**
 * <p>This constraint limits the amount of time (measured as M slots) that a set of classes may be consecutively
 * scheduled to which are each separated by no more than S slots.</p>
 * <p>This constraint limits the length of a block of two or more consecutive classes during a day (not more than M
 * slots in a block). For each day of week and week, two consecutive classes are considered to be in the same block if
 * the gap between them is not more than S time slots. For each block, the number of time slots from the start of the
 * first class in a block till the end of the last class in a block must not be more than M time slots. This means that
 * for each week w ∈ {0, 1, …, nrWeeks − 1} of the semester and each day of the week d ∈ {0, 1, …, nrDays − 1}, the
 * maximal length of a block does not exceed M slots
 * max { B.end − B.start | B ∈ MergeBlocks{(C.start, C.end)
 * | (C.days and 2d) ≠ 0 ∧ (C.weeks and 2w) ≠ 0})
 * }) ≤ M
 * Please note that only blocks of two or more classes are considered. In other words, if there is a class longer than M
 * slots, it does not break the constraint by itself, but it cannot form a larger block with another class.
 * When the constraint is soft, the penalty is multiplied by the total number of blocks that are over the M time slots,
 * computed over each day of the week and week of the semester and divided by the number of weeks of the semester at the
 * end (using integer division, just like for {@link MaxDayLoad}.).</p>
