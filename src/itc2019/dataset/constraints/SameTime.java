/**
 * <p>All classes in this constraint must be offered within the same times of day as those required by the longest class
 * in the set, i.e., the times of day they meet must be completely overlapped by the longest class in the
 * constraint.</p>
 * <p>Given classes must be taught at the same time of day, regardless of their days of week or weeks. For the classes
 * of the same length, this is the same constraint as SameStart (classes must start at the same time slot). For the
 * classes of different lengths, the shorter class can start after the longer class but must end before or at the same
 * time as the longer class.
 * This means that (Ci.start ≤ Cj.start ∧ Cj.end ≤ Ci.end) ∨ (Cj.start ≤ Ci.start ∧ Ci.end ≤ Cj.end) for any two classes
 * Ci and Cj from the constraint; Ci.end = Ci.start + Ci.length is the assigned end time slot of a class Ci.</p>
