/**
 * <p>This constraint limits the number of breaks between classes during a day which exceed S time slots to no more than
 * R per day.</p>
 * <p>This constraint limits the number of breaks during a day between a given set of classes (not more than R breaks
 * during a day). For each day of week and week, there is a break between classes if there is more than S empty time
 * slots in between.
 * Two consecutive classes are considered to be in the same block if the gap between them is not more than S time slots.
 * This means that for each week w ∈ {0, 1, …, nrWeeks − 1} of the semester and each day of the week
 * d ∈ {0, 1, …, nrDays − 1}, the number of blocks is not greater than R + 1,
 * |MergeBlocks{(C.start, C.end) | (C.days and 2d) ≠ 0 ∧ (C.weeks and 2w) ≠ 0})| ≤ R + 1
 * where 2d is a bit string with the only non-zero bit on position d and 2w is a bit string with the only non-zero bit
 * on position w. The MergeBlocks function recursively merges to the block B any two blocks Ba and Bb that are
 * identified by their start and end slots that overlap or are not more than S slots apart, until there are no more
 * blocks that could be merged.
 * (Ba.end + S ≥ Bb.start) ∧ (Bb.end + S ≥ Ba.start) ⇒ (B.start = min(Ba.start, Bb.start)) ∧ (B.end = max(Ba.end, Bb.end))
 * When the constraint is soft, the penalty is multiplied by the total number of additional breaks computed over each
 * day of the week and week of the semester and divided by the number of weeks of the semester at the end (using integer
 * division, just like for {@link MaxDayLoad}.</p>
