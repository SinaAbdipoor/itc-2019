 * violation. In other words, if M pairs of classes do not satisfy the distribution constraint, the total penalty for
 * violation of this constraint is M × penalty.</p>
 * <p>This class is basically the same as the {@link DistributionConstraint}. It only acts as a wrapper to create
 * separation between hard and soft constraints when instantiating in the {@link itc2019.dataset.ProblemInstance} for
