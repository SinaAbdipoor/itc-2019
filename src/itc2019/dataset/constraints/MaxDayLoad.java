/**
 * <p>This constraint limits the total amount of time assigned to the set of classes listed in the constraint to no more
 * than S time slots per day over the entire term.</p>
 * <p>Given classes must be spread over the days of the week (and weeks) in a way that there is no more than a given
 * number of S time slots on every day. This means that for each week w ∈ {0, 1, …, nrWeeks − 1} of the semester and
 * each day of the week d ∈ {0, 1, …, nrDays − 1}, the total number of slots assigned to classes C that overlap with the
 * selected day d and week w is not more than S,
 * DayLoad(d,w) ≤ S
 * DayLoad(d,w) = ∑i {Ci.length | (Ci.days and 2d) ≠ 0 ∧ (Ci.weeks and 2w) ≠ 0)}
 * where 2d is a bit string with the only non-zero bit on position d and 2w is a bit string with the only non-zero bit
 * on position w. When the constraint is soft (it is not required and there is a penalty), its penalty is multiplied by
 * the number of slots that exceed the given constant S over all days of the semester and divided by the number of weeks
 * of the semester (using integer division). Importantly the integer division is computed at the very end. That is
 * (penalty × ∑w,dmax(DayLoad(d,w) − S, 0)) / nrWeeks</p>
