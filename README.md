# International Timetabling Competition 2019

## Introduction

This project addresses the International Timetabling Competition (ITC) 2019 benchmark dataset, which is the current latest benchmark datatset on the University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP). It consists of a set of challenging real-world timetabling problems from different countries. The ITC 2019 aims to stimulate research on automated timetabling and to provide a common platform for comparing different approaches. Further information about this benchmark dataset can be found on the [ITC 2019 Website](https://www.itc2019.org/)

The main objectives of this project are:

- To produce a simple, standard, object-oriented implementation of the ITC 2019 in Java language to make experimentation simpler and promote future research.
- To create a framework for other methods to be easily implemented and added to the code.
- To implement, test, and compare basic meta-heuristic approaches on the ITC 2019.
- To implement and test the proposed methodology of our research.
